# Give the campaign a rule, not an engineering ticket.

## Purpose
Explain the coupons-cashback decision logic using illustrative scenarios, independently of reported project outcomes.

## Features and interaction
Three scenario buttons update one result panel immediately. Reset restores the first scenario. Controls expose aria-pressed; results use aria-live. All controls work with keyboard and touch.

## Inputs, decision logic and outputs
- Eligible returning customer → Eligible / Apply promotion / The customer matches the cohort and basket rules. Show the available savings before checkout.
- Minimum basket not met → Explain / Show the threshold / Keep the offer visible, but explain why it cannot apply to this basket.
- Offer has expired → Block / Protect the promise / Do not apply an expired campaign. Surface a valid alternative if one exists.

## Assumptions and boundaries
Sample data and simplified explanatory rules, not a production workflow, clinical recommendation or measured experiment. No backend, integrations or persistent data.

## States and edge cases
Default is scenario 1. Reselecting the active scenario is safe. Reset is idempotent. With JavaScript unavailable, the first result and all case-study text remain readable. Reduced motion disables transitions.

## Measurement
No analytics collected. Future optional events: scenario_selected (case, scenario), scenario_reset, contact_opened; require an explicit analytics decision first.
